The enormous explosion of ressentiment in the French Revolution against the nobility and everything connected with its way of living, and indeed the very emergence of this ressentiment, would have been entirely inconceivable if (according to Werner Sombartâ€Ÿs calculation in Luxus und kapitalismus, Munich 1912, pp. 10-24) more than 80% of the nobility itself had not been intermingled with bourgeois elements, who acquired names and tides by buying aristocratic estates. Besides, the nobility was racially weakened by money marriages. The ressentiment of the insurgents was sharpened by the new feeling that they were equal to the riding class.
